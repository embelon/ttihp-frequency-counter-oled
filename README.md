# Frequency Counter with SSD1306 OLED Display

This is hardened version of [SSD1306 OLED Frequency Counter](https://github.com/embelon/ssd1306_oled_frequency_counter/), prepared for and submitted as a part of Tiny Tapeout IHP, which makes it much easier and cheaper than ever to get your design manufactured on a real chip!

For project description and FPGA ready version, please refer to [SSD1306 OLED Frequency Counter](https://github.com/embelon/ssd1306_oled_frequency_counter/).
